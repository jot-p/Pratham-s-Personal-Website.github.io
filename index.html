			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hello! My name is Pratham Gill, and I am a first-year student studying software development at Bow Valley
				College. I have always been fascinated by technology and its ability to improve our lives, and I am
				excited to be pursuing a career in this field.</p>

			<p> As a software development student, I am learning programming languages such as C++,JAVA and C# as well
				as web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also gaining experience in software
				design and development methodologies, such as Agile and Waterfall.</p>

			<p> In addition to my coursework, I am passionate about exploring new technologies and applying them to
				real-world problems. I enjoy working on personal projects and contributing to open-source software
				projects, and I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.</p>

			<p>Outside of programming, I enjoy playing video games, reading science fiction novels, and spending time
				with friends and family. I am excited about the possibilities that a career in software development
				holds, and I look forward to contributing to the industry in a meaningful way.</p>
